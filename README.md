# Assignment-6-Built-in-Python-Functions
a working knowledge of many common built-in Python functions  practice intentionally calling functions

a.	What is the purpose of this program(s)?
  The purpose of these programs was to use python built in functions to find Mean, Median, and Range numbers, in the second problem, we used oct() and aschii() functions to covert number values to their appropriate versions 
b.	What does this program take as input?
  The first program took in string and converted them to int and list, the second one took in integers. 
c.	What is the expected output of the program?
  Integers values. 
  Converted version of values 
d.	What type of execution is included in your program?
The program has all 6 executions,
    1.	Input: Its askes the users for input 
    2.	Output: It prints out value. 
    3.	Sequential execution: It goes down list as it reads the code, and it happens one after another.
    4.	Conditional execution: It uses if and else statements.
    5.	Repeated execution: Loops
    6.	Reuses: We use built in functions. 
e.	How could your program be improved?
  As always program can be improved either by implemented ways to do faster or simpler. I did what I could, but I know for sure it, it can be better.
